      A bare Pod is any Pod created directly and not owned by a controller such as a
      Deployment or Job. Bare Pods are often create manually by users in an attempt to troubleshoot
      an issue. If left in the cluster, they create clutter, increase cost, and can be a security
      risk. Bare Pods can be cleaned up periodically through use of a policy. This policy finds
      and removes all bare Pods across the cluster.
